(thanks to https://opensource.com/article/19/6/python-virtual-environments-mac)

install homebrew from:

htttps://brew.sh

use brew to install pyenv:

`brew install pyenv`

`brew install zlib sqlite`

`export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/zlib/lib -L/usr/local/opt/sqlite/lib"`
`export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/zlib/include -I/usr/local/opt/sqlite/include"`

`pyenv install 3.7.3`
